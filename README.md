# 👋 Hey there, I’m @Shoooawn3

Welcome to my little corner of the internet.

- 👀 I’m interested in building useful tools that solve real-world problems — even if they start as simple ideas scribbled on a sticky note.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to turn curiosity into code. Mostly self-taught, but always guided by purpose.
- 💻 From Chrome extensions to data experiments, I love exploring and creating — sometimes for fun, sometimes for survival.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on lightweight tools, niche ideas, and anything that sparks "Hey, this might actually work."
- 📫 You can reach me via [2510074370@campus.ouj.ac.jp].
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I once built something completely unexpected that people actually liked. That’s when I knew — maybe I’m onto something.

> Not chasing perfection — just progress, one project at a time.
